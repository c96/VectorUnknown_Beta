# Chase and Other Capstone Peeps

Two things of particular note:
1. The main math logic is in the UFO_PuzzleManager script.
2. That file was written by a Math major on the team who had little programming experience. He then suddenly dropped the class and left the team in order to work more hours at his job. An Informatics major picked up the pieces and tried to salvage the file by basically re-writing it, but it is pretty confusing as  a result.
